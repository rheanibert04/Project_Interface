                        Hello everyone! This is a new project for workers with a background in finance to write <strong>prompts and responses</strong> about publicly available filings. This project is complex and requires many steps, so
                        please only work on it if you have intermediate to advanced knowledge of finance and are confident in your understanding of the instructions. <u>You may log time spent learning and reading the instructions.</u>
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <strong>Note:</strong> This is a pilot project, so please leave any questions, comments, or concerns in the chat so an admin or other workers can assist and guide you. <br />
                        <br />
                        In this project, each task consists of <strong><u>three (3) sections</u></strong>. Thoroughly read the instructions for each section before beginning to work on the project. When working on a task, each of the three
                        sections should be completed sequentially, starting with Section 1, then Section 2, and finally Section 3.

                    <p>
                        In this section, you will need to choose between <strong>1-40</strong> documents to gather information for your prompt/response pair. You will be using <strong>10-K or 10-Q annual/quarterly reports</strong> available
                        publicly, which you can search for at this link: <a href="https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch" target="_blank">https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch</a>.

                        Form <strong>10-K</strong> and Form <strong>10-Q</strong> are official reports that publicly traded companies in the United States must file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as part of their
                        regulatory obligations. These filings provide detailed financial and operational information, giving investors and the public a clear picture of the company's performance and business activities.
                    </p>
                    <p>Please follow these steps to find and select the forms. It is recommended to read the instructions for Sections 2 and 3 before carrying out these steps to understand what the documents will be used for.</p>

                        In this section, you will write a prompt/question that can be answered using your above documents. Ensure your prompt requires information from at least 1 document and at most 40. We are looking for three types of
                        questions in this project—-please distribute your submissions relatively evenly among the categories.

                                    expenses like wages and benefits or occupancy costs?

                                    sheets. Which model is currently yielding better profitability and why? How does the choice between franchising and company ownership impact cash flow stability and growth potential?

                    <p>In this section, you will write an ideal response to your prompt. Please follow these steps:</p>

                        <li>
                            Write your direct answer to the prompt in the “Response” box, answering the prompt as thoroughly as possible. Do not directly reference the documents in your answer. Your response should act as an ideal AI model
                            response to a user's query, in which the user does not have access to the documents; these documents are just analyzed behind the scenes to gather information for a great answer. Your response will act as the
                            basis of comparison against an AI model's response to your prompt in future projects.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In the “Supporting Facts” box, include any supporting facts you relied on to answer the prompt in a numbered list. Each page or continuous range of pages you use from the documents should be recorded as a
                            separate Supporting Fact. In other words, don't put too much information from many different pages in a single fact; please split these up. Do not directly mention the report in any way (e.g. do not say “This
                            metric was found on page 63 in the Balance Sheet table”). Fill in this box with statements of fact or quotes from the document, without needing to cite your sources or state where the information came from. You
                            will do this in the next step.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Example: <i>"Starbucks's net revenue was $7,516,000,000 as of the quarter ending on June 30, 2024"</i></li>
                            </ul>
                            <strong>Note:</strong> In the future, raters will evaluate a model's answers to the prompts you write; however, we don’t want them to have to read the supporting documents. We will provide them with your response
                            and supporting facts to be able to judge the model answer. So, in the “Supporting Facts” box, be sure to include all the information a rater would need to fact-check the model’s response, with no mentions of the
                            documents as these will not be accessible.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Next, you will see the “Cited Sources” box. For each number in your “Supporting Facts” list, list the pages of the PDF file that your information came from. Include this as a numbered list as well, with your
                            numbers aligning with the previous list. This will make it easier for reviewers to check your submission. Don't worry too much about your formatting here; just make it easy enough for another worker to
                            understand.
                        </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Example: <i>"1. Document 2, pages 13-15</i>" means Supporting Fact 1 came from pages 13-15 in the 2nd PDF you uploaded.</li>
                            <li>Example: <i>"2. Document 3, page 60</i>" means Supporting Fact 2 came from page 60 in the 3rd PDF you uploaded.</li>
